The CISUC Junior Series is a seminar initiative designed specifically for our junior members. The primary goal is to foster a collaborative environment where Master's and PhD students can interact, present their ongoing research to peers, and stimulate lively discussion.

Each session features brief presentations (7 slides, 10 minutes) followed by an extensive discussion period (20 minutes). Students are encouraged to share both scientific and technical aspects of their work. To spark further conversation and highlight exciting developments, the final two slides of each presentation must be reserved for "Challenges" and "Cool Stuff."

This format serves as a key platform for sharing knowledge, receiving feedback, and strengthening our internal research community.
