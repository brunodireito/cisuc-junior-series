The CoffeeAlgorithm is a seminar series designed to foster a collaborative environment where Master's and PhD students (and, of course, full members and collaborators) can interact, present their ongoing research, and stimulate lively discussion. This series is a key platform for sharing ongoing research, receiving candid feedback, and strengthening our internal research community.


Each session is fast-paced and discussion-driven, featuring a 10-minute, 10-slide presentation followed by an extensive 30-minute group discussion.

Presenters are encouraged to share both scientific and technical aspects of their work. To spark genuine conversation, the final two slides are mandatory and must be reserved for "I'm Stuck": A space to present a current problem and crowdsource ideas; "Cool Stuff": A moment to share exciting breakthroughs or discoveries.


When: Every second Wednesday of the month, we meet at 13:15. 

Where: room A.5.1 (And yes, as the name implies, coffee will be served!)
